# GND-CTRL 

GND-CTRL is an experimental web-based app for controlling the COM-GND Espresso Lab Open Source Hardware project. It connects to the COM-GND control hardware module via Bluetooth and allows for advanced shot profiling. 

This project is in alpha stage and under ongoing development - use with caution. 


## Creating Custom Shot Profiles

Profiles are stored in the `/profiles` directory. Each profile is a javascript class that extends the `profile` base class. 

Because the profile file is written in javascript, the shot can be profiled with great flexibility and conditional design. See the `blooming-espresso.js` file a simple example of the api.

GND-CTRL is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Development
### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
